# Crazy Bouncy Balls

A web-based physics sandbox that simulates elastic collisions and environmental forces. This project renders interactive objects directly in the DOM, allowing for real-time manipulation of physical properties and visual styles through a built-in editor.

### Features

* **Physics Control:** Adjust global or individual settings for gravity, wind, wall elasticity, and collision restitution.
* **Environment Manipulation:** Toggle between bounded walls or "Portal Walls" (seamless screen wrapping).
* **Visual Modes:** Switch between Light, Dark, and Glow themes. Enable 3D texturing, motion trails, and dynamic color cycling.
* **Interactivity:** Drag objects via mouse or touch. Mobile users can utilize gyroscope controls to influence gravity and wind.
* **Destructibility:** Toggle "Combustible Lemons" to enable high-velocity explosive collisions.
* **Many More Features:** Try it out for yourself to see all additional features.
